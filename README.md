## Supervised Learning:

# Binary Search Tree:
Binary search tree with: add node, bfs, dfs, tree validation, delete, find, and search methods.


# Decision Tree:
Decision Tree made for analysing data and its labels. All attributes are recommended to be numerical. 
Gini index of the related nodes is considered to achieve the largest information gain to select the best splits.
For simplicity, IRIS dataset is used to test the code. 


# K Nearest Neighbor (KNN):
KNN algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbor) to used for both classification and regression predictive problems. 
For simplicity, IRIS dataset is used to test the code. 





## Unsupervised Learning:

# Kmeans & Kmeans-Plus-Plus:
1- Kmeans plus plus algorithm to initialize the centroids to be used in the kmeans algorithm
Centroids are initialized based on their probability index set by their distance from each other
2- Kmeans algorithm to cluster data into groups
For simplicity, WINE dataset is used to test the code.
