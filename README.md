## Supervised Learning:

### Binary Search Tree:
Binary search tree with: add node, bfs, dfs, tree validation, delete node, find node, and search node methods.


### Decision Tree:
Decision Tree made for splitting data for best attributes. All attributes are recommended to be numerical. 
Gini index of the related nodes is considered to achieve the largest information gain to select the best splits.
For simplicity, IRIS dataset is used to test the code. 


### K Nearest Neighbor (KNN):
KNN algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbor) for both classification and regression problems. 
For simplicity, IRIS dataset is used to test the code. 




## Unsupervised Learning:

### Kmeans & Kmeans-Plus-Plus:
1- Kmeans plus plus algorithm to initialize the centroids 
Centroids are initialized based on their probability index set by their distance from each other

2- Kmeans algorithm to cluster data into groups
For simplicity, WINE dataset is used to test the code.
