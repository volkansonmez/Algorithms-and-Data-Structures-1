# Algorithms and Data-Structures for Data Science and Machine Learning 
(Algorithms and Data Structures Simplified)



## Supervised Learning:

### Decision Tree:
Decision Tree made for splitting data for its best attributes. All attributes are recommended to be numerical. If not, all
attributes should be converted into numerical values and standardized before executing the tree for training.
By measuring the gini index of the related (parent-child) nodes, the splits are made to achieve the largest information gain. 

### Random Forest:
To make a Random Forest there needs to be n decision trees which are the building blocks of Random Forest algorithm. Find the optimal number of trees trained with optimal portion of the data and the optimal gini for achieving the best accuracy.

### K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN):
KNN algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbor) for both classification and regression problems. 



## Unsupervised Learning:

### Kmeans & Kmeans-Plus-Plus:
First Part: Kmeans plus plus algorithm to initialize the centroids. The centroids are initialized based on their probability index set by their distance from each other

Second Part: Kmeans algorithm to cluster data into groups
 


## Data Structures:

### Linked List:
Singly Connected Linked List with 20+ methods and its FIFO and LIFO applications. 

### Doubly Connected Linked List:
Doubly Connected Linked List with several methods.

### Binary Search Tree:
Binary search tree with: add node, bfs, dfs, tree validation, delete node, find node, and search node methods.
