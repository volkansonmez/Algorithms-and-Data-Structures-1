## Supervised Learning:

### Decision Tree:
Decision Tree made for splitting data for best attributes. All attributes are recommended to be numerical. If not, all
attributes should be converted into numerical values and standardized before executing for splits.
Gini index of the related nodes is considered to achieve the largest information gain to optimize the best splits.

### Random Forest:
To make a Random Forest there needs to be n decision trees which are the building blocks of Random Forest algorithm. Find the optimal number of trees trained with optimal portion of the data and the optimal gini for achieving the best accuracy.

### K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN):
KNN algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbor) for both classification and regression problems. 



## Unsupervised Learning:

### Kmeans & Kmeans-Plus-Plus:
1- Kmeans plus plus algorithm to initialize the centroids 
Centroids are initialized based on their probability index set by their distance from each other

2- Kmeans algorithm to cluster data into groups
 


## Data Structures:

### Linked List:
Singly Linked List with 20+ methods. FIFO and LIFO applications. 

### Doubly Connected Linked List:
Doubly Connected Linked List with several methods.

### Binary Search Tree:
Binary search tree with: add node, bfs, dfs, tree validation, delete node, find node, and search node methods.
